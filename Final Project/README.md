# Utah Native Evergreen Tree Identification

## Synopsis
This program uses a simple flow-chart format to help a user identify Utah Native Evergreen trees using identifiable physical characteristics of trees
found in the wild wile hiking, camping, etc.

## Motivation
I built this program because I enjoy learning how to identify Utah native flora. I plan on building upon and expanding this project in the future.

## How to Run
To run this program - import the Tree.java (Object Class) and Driver.java into any Java IDE. As of now, this program will only run in an IDE console.
